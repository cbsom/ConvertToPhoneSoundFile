# Convert To Phone Sound File

A very simple and straightforward .net core 3.1 desktop application that uses ffmpeg to convert a sound file to 8 bit u-law.

This is useful for playing over a phone line - such as for using as a recording for Twilio's "Play" verb.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The app expects to find ffmpeg.exe in the root folder.

Ffmpeg can be acquired at https://www.ffmpeg.org/
